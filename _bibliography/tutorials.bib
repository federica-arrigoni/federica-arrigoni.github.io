  abstract={Many of the computer vision problems involve processing multiple entities be it objects, shapes, views or scenes. In such cases, graphs a.k.a. networks, are the key data structures for storing and organizing information. Yet, relationships between individual entities that had to be encoded in the edges often remain pairwise, or rather local. One of the most well accepted methods of seeking a global agreement is enforcing cycle-consistency, where the local errors are distributed over the entire graph such that the composition of maps/transforms along the cycles is close to the identity map. This art of consistently recovering absolute quantities from a collection of ratios is known as synchronization. From training generative adversial networks to geometric structure from motion algorithms, from temporal video understanding to image-to-image translation, this capability of imposing consistency benefits a wide variety of vision tasks.}

  abstract={The synchronization problem has attracted a lot of attention in the community thanks to its application in a variety of Computer Vision tasks. The goal of ``synchronization'' is to infer the unknown states of a network of nodes, where only the ratio (or difference) between pairs of states can be measured. Typically, states are represented by elements of a group, such as the Symmetric Group or the Special Euclidean Group. The former can for example represent local labels of a set of features, as it occurs in multi-view matching applications. The latter can for example represent camera reference frames (e.g., in the context of structure from motion or pose graph optimization), or local coordinates of 3D points when dealing with 3D registration. Other applications include image mosaicking (where states are represented as homographies) and motion segmentation (where states are represented as binary matrices).}
